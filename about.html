    <h1>I'm Megan-lee Moulang.</h1>
    <p> I'm thrilled to apply for Year 3 of the Journalism program. My journey in journalism began with a desire to uncover and share the untold stories that shape our world. Over the past two years, I've honed my skills in research, reporting, and storytelling, all while cultivating a deep passion for the power of media to inform and inspire. I believe that journalism is the bridge between information and impact, and I'm committed to being a part of that transformative process. My experiences, including varioud additional work outside of  the course work, have given me a unique perspective on the industry, and I'm eager to continue expanding my knowledge and skills in this dynamic field. I look forward to the opportunity to learn from and collaborate with my peers and mentors, all in the pursuit of truth, ethical reporting, and meaningfulÂ storytelling</p>
